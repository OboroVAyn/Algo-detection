# ðŸ’° Fake Banknotes Detection

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to detect fake banknotes from a given dataset. The dataset includes various features that describe the characteristics of the banknotes, and our objective is to predict whether a given banknote is real or fake.

## Dataset
- ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**: billets - Banknote Authentication dataset : The dataset used in this project contains **1,500 rows** and multiple features related to banknote characteristics.
- ðŸ’³ **Features**: 
  - **Length (cm)** â€“ Length of the banknote  
  - **Diagonal (cm)** â€“ Diagonal measurement of the banknote  
  - **Height Left (cm)** â€“ Height of the banknote on the left side  
  - **Height Right (cm)** â€“ Height of the banknote on the right side  
  - **Margin Low (cm)** â€“ Lower margin of the banknote  
  - **Margin Up (cm)** â€“ Upper margin of the banknote  
  - **Is_Genuine** (True/False) â€“ Indicates whether the banknote is genuine (True) or fake (False)  

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (if any) and outliers.
   - Feature scaling to standardize continuous variables.
   
2. **Modeling**:
   - Used **Logistic Regression** for classification.
   - Applied **K-means clustering** to better understand the data distribution.
   
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Used a **confusion matrix** to visualize model performance.

## Tools
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For detailed analysis and code execution.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, K-means

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 98.5%
- **Precision**: 97.8%
- **Recall**: 99.1%
- **F1-Score**: 98.4%
- **Confusion Matrix**: The model correctly identified most of the fake notes, with very few false positives.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FrankMoukalla/Fake-Banknotes-Detection.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Fake_Banknotes_Detection.ipynb
    ```
